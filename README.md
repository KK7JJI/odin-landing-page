# Project Notes:
This webpage mockup was developed while working through the Foundations course portion of 
The Odin Project's online course for aspiring web developers. It's a solution to the 
project/exercise titled "Landing Page" where the student is asked to develop a single webpage 
from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox concepts previously learned through the course.

Images in this webpage were created using Google Gemini, they aren't intended to be anything more than tools to illustrate the webpage's formating.
